**Lode Purrer** is a high-stakes, feline-themed reimagining of the classic *Lode Runner*. Play as a clever cat on a mission to collect every golden fish while outsmarting an escalating army of persistent dogs across 100 unique levels.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **100 Unique Levels**: 20 meticulously hand-crafted levels followed by 80 procedurally generated challenges.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Dogs increase in speed by **10% every 10 levels**.
- **The "Pee" Mechanic**: Press `P` to leave a puddle on the floor. Dogs that step in it are significantly slowed down, giving you time to escape.
- **AI-Powered Infinite Mode**: Once you pass level 100, the **Google Gemini API** takes over, generating infinite new levels with custom themes on the fly.
- **Cat Physics**: Precise double-jumping, climbing, and the ability to "claw" through bricks above you (`S` key).
- **Aesthetic Themes**: Visual styles evolve every 10 levels, culminating in a **Psychedelic RGB** finale for levels 91-100.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) utilizing modern hooks (`useCallback`, `useRef`, `useEffect`) for a high-performance 60FPS game loop.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a responsive, modern UI with custom animations and glassmorphism effects.
- **Intelligence**: [@google/genai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai) (Google Gemini SDK) for advanced procedural level generation and safety-checked grid layouts.
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for crisp, scalable interface elements.
- **Audio**: Integrated SFX system for immersive feedback (Walking, Jumping, Barking, Gold Collection).
- **Engine**: Custom-built tile-based physics engine with gravity, terminal velocity, and sub-pixel collision detection.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser. The app uses ES Modules to load dependencies directly from `esm.sh`, requiring no complex build steps.

*Note: For AI level generation beyond level 100, ensure your environment provides a valid `process.env.API_KEY` for the Google Gemini API.*
